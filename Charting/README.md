# BUSK.Charting & BUSK.Charting.WPF

### These projects are merely a copy of the well-known and wonderful [**LiveCharts**](https://github.com/Live-Charts/Live-Charts) library.

I needed a .NET Core version of that library but
- [**LiveCharts**](https://github.com/Live-Charts/Live-Charts) repo seemed to be dead
- the creator [**beto-rodriguez**](https://github.com/beto-rodriguez) has no recent activities 
- the original repo has too many extras (such as UWP & WinForms versions, tests, examples, certificates & etc.).

So instead of
- creating a fork, porting them to .NET Core,
- maintaing them separately,
- publishing a new NuGet package (maybe?) and
- updating them together with the original (please no!!!)

I just copy-pasted them into a new personal-use project just for my specific need with-out the extra-loads **(Sorry if what I did was wrong).**

To say this is just a port to .NET Core 3.1 and namespace changes from **LiveCharts** to **BUSK.Charting**. This project contains the **base library** and the **WPF control library** of **LiveCharts**

### Disclaimer

I'm don't know much about Software Licensing, if what I did was against the terms and conditions don't sue me (please!!!). This project is just for personal-use inside my project.

Any issues specific to these charting projects must be posted in the original repo : [LiveCharts](https://github.com/Live-Charts/Live-Charts) and I'm not doing any new changes to them.
